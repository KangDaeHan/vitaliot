Installation:

Need to have npm, bower installed.
Then you run
> npm install
> bower install
> grunt build

- If all goes well, the build/ folder will contain the application

> grunt dist
- Will produce the minified version of the application

> grunt server
- Runs grunt build, starts a web server on localhost:8001 and watches for file changes to dynamically update the application
